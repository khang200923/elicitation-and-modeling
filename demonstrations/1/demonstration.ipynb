      "The actual answer provided by the subject notably contrasts with the expected answers in several significant ways. Firstly, the subject expresses a lack of enthusiasm for horror movies in general, claiming not to be a fan, whereas the expected responses are filled with passion and enthusiasm for specific horror films. Secondly, unlike the expected answers which highlight multiple iconic horror films, the subject only mentions one movie, 'A Quiet Place,' indicating a limited engagement with the genre. Furthermore, the expected answers emphasize deep appreciation for elements such as atmosphere, psychological depth, and iconic performances, while the subject primarily focuses on the thrill of suspense in 'A Quiet Place,' lacking the same nuance and adoration found in the expected responses. Lastly, the expected answers typically feature a more diverse range of classic and contemporary horror films, showcasing a broader interest and knowledge of the genre, while the subject's response suggests a more isolated experience with horror cinema.\n"
